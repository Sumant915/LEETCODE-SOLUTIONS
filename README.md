# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems solved on LeetCode.
All solutions are automatically synchronized from my LeetCode account upon successful submission.

## 📖 Overview
The purpose of this repository is to maintain a structured and consistent record of my
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice. It reflects my problem-solving journey
and continuous improvement over time.

The solutions here are not manually uploaded; they are pushed automatically using
a LeetCode–GitHub integration.

## 📚 Topics Covered
This repository includes problems from a wide range of DSA topics, such as:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Hashing
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Recursion
- Basic Dynamic Programming
- Searching and Sorting
- Two Pointers and Sliding Window techniques

## 💻 Programming Languages
